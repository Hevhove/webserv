/*
A client sends an HTTP request to the server in the form of a request message,
beginning with a method, URI, and protocol version, followed by MIME-like header fields containing request modifiers,
client information, and payload metadata, an empty line to indicate the end of the header section, and finally the payload body (if any).

Example:
  GET /hello.txt HTTP/1.1
  User-Agent: curl/7.16.3 libcurl/7.16.3 OpenSSL/0.9.7l zlib/1.2.3
  Host: www.example.com
